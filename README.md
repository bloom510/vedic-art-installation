This full-stack art piece recycles an old favorite algorithm. Originally done by hand (to be my first JavaScript app) in a musical theoretical exploration,this piece explores the visual space created when we assign algorithm outputs to individual vectors distributed across the window's width and height respectively. 

Technologies used:

- Nodejs and Express
- Socket.io to crunch and send off numbers from server to client
- Canvas API, using a hidden context and putImageData() to optimize rendering efficiency.
- Next is to re-factor the piece into the PIXIjs framework with 2d WebGL GPU acceleration.
